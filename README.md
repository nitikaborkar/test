# Retention Stage: Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction Model

Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) prediction is a critical aspect of customer retention strategy. It helps in identifying the long-term value of a customer to the bank, allowing for strategic decisions on where to invest marketing and retention efforts.

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction Model

**Objective:**

- Predict the lifetime value of customers to prioritize high-value customers for retention and targeted marketing campaigns.
- Optimize resource allocation by focusing on customers with the highest potential value.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
    - Collect and preprocess customer data, including transactional, behavioral, and demographic information.
    - Historical transaction data and customer interaction logs are crucial.
2. **Attribute Selection:**
    - **Raw Attributes:**
        - Customer ID
        - Age
        - Income
        - Occupation
        - Credit score (CIBIL score)
        - Product holdings (e.g., savings account, loan, credit card)
        - Transaction history (frequency, recency, monetary value)
        - Customer interactions (e.g., website visits, customer service interactions)
        - Complaint logs and resolution times
        - Tenure with the bank
    - **Derived Attributes:**
        - Average purchase value: Average value of transactions.
        - Purchase frequency: Number of purchases in a given period.
        - Recency: Time since the last purchase.
        - Engagement score: Measure of overall engagement with the bank's services.
        - Customer satisfaction score: Derived from surveys or feedback forms.
        - Churn probability: Probability of the customer leaving the bank.
    - **Target Variable:**
        - CLTV: Predicted monetary value of a customer over their entire relationship with the bank.
3. **Model Selection:**
    - **Regression Algorithms:**
        - Linear Regression
        - Random Forest Regressor
        - Gradient Boosting Regressor
        - XGBoost
        - Neural Networks
    - **Evaluation Metrics:**
        - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
        - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
        - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
        - R-squared (RÂ²)

### Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
    
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    
    # Sample customer data
    data = {
        'customer_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'age': [25, 45, 35, 50, 23],
        'income': [50000, 120000, 75000, 100000, 45000],
        'cibil_score': [700, 800, 750, 780, 690],
        'product_holdings': ['savings,loan', 'savings,credit card', 'savings,loan', 'savings', 'loan'],
        'transaction_frequency': [15, 50, 25, 30, 10],
        'average_transaction_value': [2000, 5000, 3000, 4000, 1500],
        'engagement_score': [3, 5, 4, 4, 2],
        'tenure': [2, 10, 5, 8, 1],
        'cltv': [20000, 120000, 75000, 100000, 45000]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    
    # Encode categorical variables
    encoder = OneHotEncoder()
    encoded_products = encoder.fit_transform(df[['product_holdings']]).toarray()
    df = df.join(pd.DataFrame(encoded_products, columns=encoder.get_feature_names_out(['product_holdings']))).drop('product_holdings', axis=1)
    
    # Standardize numerical features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    numerical_features = ['age', 'income', 'cibil_score', 'transaction_frequency', 'average_transaction_value', 'engagement_score', 'tenure']
    df[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(df[numerical_features])
    
    # Split data into train and test sets
    X = df.drop(['customer_id', 'cltv'], axis=1)
    y = df['cltv']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    ```
    
2. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    
    **Gradient Boosting Regressor:**
    
    ```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score
    import numpy as np
    
    # Train Gradient Boosting model
    model = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Predict on test data
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Evaluate model performance
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    
    print(f'Mean Absolute Error: {mae}')
    print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
    print(f'Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse}')
    print(f'R-squared: {r2}')
    
    ```
