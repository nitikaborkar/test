# Look-alike Modelling in Banking

**Objective:** Identify potential new customers who resemble existing high-value customers to target them with tailored marketing campaigns effectively.

### Key Modelling Algorithm

1. **Random Forest:**
    - **Description:** Ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions to improve accuracy.
    - **Use Case:** Effective for classifying potential customers as similar or dissimilar to high-value customers.

### Important Variables for Look-alike Modelling (Indian Banking Perspective)

1. **Profiles of High-value Customers:**
    - **Attributes:** Transaction history, product holdings, creditworthiness, demographic information.
    - **Derived Attributes:** Lifetime value, profitability score, churn propensity.
2. **Transaction History of Potential Customers:**
    - **Attributes:** Transaction frequency, transaction amount, product usage.

### Detailed Example of Look-alike Modelling Implementation

### Step-by-Step Implementation Using Random Forest

1. **Data Preparation:**
    - Utilize existing campaign data (seed data) containing client attributes and campaign-related information.
    - Handle missing values and outliers, preprocess data for modelling.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
    - **Attributes:**
        - Transaction history
        - Product holdings
        - Creditworthiness
        - Demographic information
    - **Derived Attributes:**
        - Lifetime value
        - Profitability score
        - Churn propensity
3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score, precision_score
    
    # Sample data preparation
    # Assume df is the preprocessed and sampled data
    X = df.drop('high_value_customer', axis=1)
    y = df['high_value_customer']
    
    # Split data into train and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    # Apply SMOTE to handle class imbalance
    smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
    X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Train Random Forest model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)
    
    # Predictions on test data
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Evaluation metrics
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
    roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred)
    precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
    
    ```
    
4. **Interpretation and Actionable Insights:**
    - Analyze model performance using evaluation metrics like Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Precision.
    - Use the trained model to predict potential investors among the remaining client base (pool data).
    - Target the predicted look-alikes with personalized marketing campaigns to increase conversion rates and build a loyal and profitable customer base.

### Variables for Targeting

1. **Look-alike Segment:**
    - **Attributes:** Transaction history, product holdings, creditworthiness, demographic information.
    - **Derived Attributes:** Lifetime value, profitability score, churn propensity.
    - **Target Variables:** Likelihood of becoming a high-value customer, expected lifetime value.

By following this approach, the bank can effectively identify and target potential customers who resemble their high-value customers, leading to improved marketing campaign effectiveness and overall business performance.
