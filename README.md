# Engagement Stage: Cross-Selling and Upselling

After identifying and targeting potential new customers through look-alike or uplift modeling, the next step is to enhance engagement by focusing on cross-selling and upselling opportunities. This stage aims to deepen the relationship with existing customers by encouraging them to purchase additional products or services.

### Cross-Selling and Upselling

**Objective:**

- Increase the average revenue per customer by recommending relevant additional products or services based on customer needs and behavior.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
    - Collect and preprocess customer data to ensure it is clean and suitable for analysis.
    - Data sources include transaction history, product holdings, demographic information, and engagement metrics.
2. **Attribute Selection:**
    - **Raw Attributes:**
        - Age
        - Income
        - Occupation
        - Credit score (CIBIL score)
        - Existing product holdings (e.g., types of accounts, loans, credit cards)
        - Transaction history (frequency, recency, monetary value)
        - Customer interaction data (e.g., customer service interactions, website visits)
    - **Derived Attributes:**
        - Product affinity score: Likelihood of interest in a specific product based on past behavior and similar customer profiles.
        - Engagement score: Measure of overall engagement with the bank's services.
        - Transaction trends: Patterns in spending and saving behavior.
        - Churn propensity: Likelihood of customer attrition.
        - Lifetime value (LTV): Projected long-term value of the customer to the bank.
    - **Target Variables:**
        - Response to cross-sell or upsell offers (binary: yes/no)
        - Purchase of additional products (e.g., loans, credit cards)
3. **Model Selection:**
    - **Recommendation System:** Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, or Hybrid models.
    - **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Neural Networks.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
    
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler
    
    # Sample customer data
    data = {
        'age': [25, 45, 35, 50, 23],
        'income': [50000, 120000, 75000, 100000, 45000],
        'cibil_score': [700, 800, 750, 780, 690],
        'existing_products': ['savings', 'loan', 'credit card', 'savings', 'loan'],
        'transaction_frequency': [15, 50, 25, 30, 10],
        'average_transaction_value': [2000, 5000, 3000, 4000, 1500],
        'engagement_score': [3, 5, 4, 4, 2],
        'response_to_cross_sell': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    
    # Encode categorical variables
    encoder = OneHotEncoder()
    encoded_products = encoder.fit_transform(df[['existing_products']]).toarray()
    df = df.join(pd.DataFrame(encoded_products, columns=encoder.get_feature_names_out(['existing_products']))).drop('existing_products', axis=1)
    
    # Standardize numerical features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    numerical_features = ['age', 'income', 'cibil_score', 'transaction_frequency', 'average_transaction_value', 'engagement_score']
    df[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(df[numerical_features])
    
    ```
    
2. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    
    ```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
    
    # Split data into features and target variable
    X = df.drop(['response_to_cross_sell'], axis=1)
    y = df['response_to_cross_sell']
    
    # Train-test split
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    # Train Random Forest model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Predict and evaluate
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    
    ```
    
3. **Recommendation System (Alternative Approach):**
    
    **Collaborative Filtering Example:**
    
    ```python
    from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
    import numpy as np
    
    # Sample matrix of customer-product interactions
    interaction_matrix = np.array([
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
        [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
    ])
    
    # Train a KNN model for collaborative filtering
    model_cf = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=2, algorithm='auto')
    model_cf.fit(interaction_matrix)
    
    # Find similar customers
    customer_index = 0  # Example customer index
    distances, indices = model_cf.kneighbors(interaction_matrix[customer_index].reshape(1, -1), n_neighbors=2)
    similar_customers = indices.flatten()
    
    print(f"Customers similar to customer {customer_index}: {similar_customers}")
    
    ```
    
4. **Deploy and Monitor:**
    - Deploy the trained models to the bank's marketing system.
    - Monitor customer responses to cross-sell and upsell offers.
    - Continuously refine the models based on new data and feedback.
